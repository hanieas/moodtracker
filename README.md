# Mood Tracker

In order to track my mood every day, I created a mood tracker application.
       
You can use this application too and share your experience with me. It's open-source, and you are welcome to look at the code and report any ideas or bugs.
         
I have some ideas to get this application more useful and user-friendly so if you think you can help me text me.
